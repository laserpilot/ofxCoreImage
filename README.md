ofxCoreImage
============

This gives you several classes to easily use OSX's Core image filters within openFrameworks

CURRENTLY A WORK IN PROGRESS - DON'T USE IN PRODUCTION YET

This lets you really easily implement Core Image Filters into OF programs on OSX only. The document "CIFilters.txt" gives you a list/attributes/description of all possible built in filters. EVentually more filters will be built out into their own class.
